  ## COFFEE__FILTER
  
  ➞ The COFFEE_FILTER is basically a filter to get rid of all the **** to actually count for the words. It doesn't work w/ punctuation yet but it is a somewhat good filter at least to my standards.
  
  ### To activate
  
  ➞ Go to the Terminal of COFFEE_FILTER and type in COFFEE_FILTER.py
